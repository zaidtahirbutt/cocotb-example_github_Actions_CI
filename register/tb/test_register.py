'''
A cocotb-pytest test (this file) has two parts:

1. Testbench 
    - Any python function decorated with @cocotb.test()
    - Drives signals into pins of the design, reads the output/intermediate pins and compares with expected results
    - Uses async-await: 
        - Declared as def async
        - when "await Event()", simulator advances in simulation time until the Event() happens
    - You can have multiple such testbenches too. Pytest would find and run them all
2. PyTest 
    - The setup that connects the simulator of your choice, 
    - Feeds the design files, 
    - Finds your testbenches (1), 
    - Parametrizes them to generate multiple versions of the designs & tests
    - Runs all such tests and prints a report of pass & fails
